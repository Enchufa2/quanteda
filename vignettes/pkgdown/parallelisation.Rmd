**quanteda** takes advantage of parallel computing through the [TBB (Threading Building Blocks) library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threading_Building_Blocks) to speed up computations. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up your system for using Quanteda with parallel capabilities on Windows, macOS, and Linux.


## For Windows Users

### Install RTools

- Download and install RTools from [RTools download page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
- During installation, ensure you select the option to add RTools to the system path.

### Check Installation

- Open an R session and check that RTools is correctly configured:
  ```R
  find.package("pkgbuild")
  ```

## For macOS users

### Opening the Terminal

To open the terminal on macOS, press `Cmd+Space` to open Spotlight, type "Terminal", and press enter. Alternatively, you can find the Terminal in `/Applications/Utilities/`.

### Install required tools and libraries

1. **Install XCode Command Line Tools**
   - Type the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     xcode-select --install
     ```

2. **Install Homebrew**
   - If Homebrew is not installed, run:
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```
   - Follow the on-screen instructions.

3. **Install TBB and pkg-config**
   - After installing Homebrew, run:
     ```bash
     brew install tbb pkg-config
     ```

4. **Install gfortran**
   - Required for compiling Fortran code, install using Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install gcc
     ```

## For Linux users

### Opening the terminal

To open the terminal in Linux, you can usually use `Ctrl+Alt+T`, or search for "Terminal" in your system's application launcher.

### Install TBB

- **For Fedora, CentOS, RHEL**:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install tbb-devel
  ```
- **For Debian and Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libtbb-dev
  ```

## Installing **quanteda** from CRAN

After setting up the required tools and libraries, install **quanteda** from CRAN:

```R
install.packages("quanteda")
```

Parallelisation functions properly if you receive a message detailing the number of threads used for parallel computing after loading **quanteda**.

```R
library(quanteda)
# Package version: 4.0.2
# Unicode version: 15.1
# ICU version: 74.1
# Parallel computing: 20 of 20 threads used.
# See https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.
```
